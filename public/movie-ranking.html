<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This film was a combination of several emotions including happy, sad, funny and inspiring, all at once. While it showed everything that is wrong with the Indian educational system, it also taught us how we must believe in ourselves and our capabilities and that as long as we choose the career that we enjoy, we will always succeed!</p>
<h3>Taare Zameen par</h3>
<p>We have all watched this movie time and again and appreciated Mr. Aamir Khan for all the inspiring messages he tries to convey through his movies. This movie changed a lot of mind-sets in our country and taught us a great lesson to help people and never underestimate their capabilities.</p>
<h3>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</h3>
<p>It tells the story of an Indian multimillionaire family, which faces troubles and misunderstandings over their adopted son's marriage to a girl belonging to a lower socio-economic group than them.</p>
